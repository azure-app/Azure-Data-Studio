### Windows installation

Important

Beginning with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18.7 through 19.3, Azure Data Studio is automatically installed alongside SSMS. Users of SQL Server Management Studio are now able to benefit from the innovations and features in Azure Data Studio. Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform and open-source desktop tool for your environments, whether in the cloud, on-premises, or hybrid.

To learn more about Azure Data Studio, check out [What is Azure Data Studio?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio) or the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/faq).

This release of Azure Data Studio includes a standard Windows installer experience and a .zip file.

We recommend the _user installer_, which simplifies installations and updates and doesn't require administrator privileges because the location is under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder.

The user installer also provides a smoother background update experience. For more information, see [User setup for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_user-setup-for-windows).

    Windows Command Prompt Copy

For Windows, install Azure Data Studio in the background without prompts using the following steps:

1.  Open the command prompt window with elevated permissions.
    
2.  Run the following command:
    
    Console Copy
    
    ```
    <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
    ```

    Console Copy
    
    ```
    %systemdrive%\azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-1.24.0.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode
    ```

    > Console Copy
    > 
    > ```
    > <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>

3.  If you've run the commands successfully, you can see Azure Data Studio installed.
